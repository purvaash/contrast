## At IIT Bombay (IITB)

During my stay at [IITB](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), I studied near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) under the supervision of [Prof. Karthik Sasihithlu](https://www.ese.iitb.ac.in/faculty/karthik-sasihithlu). I explored how, in NFRHT, evanescent waves contribute to radiative heat transfer, resulting in super-Planckian behaviour. It is called super-Planckian as the heat transferred between the two objects exceeds the black body limit. As the distance between the objects decreases, the amount of heat transferred can be $10^5$ times the black body limit.

I studied how the near-field behaviour depends on the optical properties of the material. Later, I studied and reproduced results of Prof. Karthik Sasihithlu's paper, Coupled harmonic oscillator model to describe surface-mode mediated heat transfer. In the final stages of the project, I tried simulating NFRHT using molecular dynamics under the supervision of Prof. Karthik Sasihithlu and [Prof. M. P. Gururajan](https://www.iitb.ac.in/mems/en/prof-m-p-gururajan).

## At Weizmann Instiute of Science (WIS)

During my stay at [WIS](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/), I am working on particle physics phenomenology under the supervision of [Prof. Yosef Nir's group](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/particle/nir/group-members). In my current project, I study Higgs boson decays in the context of BSM physics. Implications and constraints of a couple of BSM frameworks are obtained. For example, bounds on energy scales and consequences in baryogenesis are explored.
