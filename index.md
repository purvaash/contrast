I just completed my masters at the [Department of Particle Physics and Astrophysics](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/particle/), [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/). During my stay at [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/), I worked on particle physics phenomenology under the supervision of [Prof. Yosef Nir](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/particle/nir/group-members). Starting October 2024, I will be moving to [the Statistical Physics departement at SISSA](https://www.statphys.sissa.it/wordpress/) to pursue my PhD!

My research experience has been in [near-field radiative heat transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_radiative_heat_transfer), [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) and [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson) phenomenology. 

I do yoga, read manga and watch anime in my free time.
