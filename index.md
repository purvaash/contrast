I am a master's student at the [Department of Particle Physics and Astrophysics](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/particle/), [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/). I am currently working on particle physics phenomenology under the supervision of [Prof. Yosef Nir](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/particle/nir/group-members). 

My research interests lie in theoretical physics. In the future, I would like to
infuse computational methods like deep learning, tensor networks and quantum computing in my projects. Using deep learning to study jet structure or to develop a generative network producing collider events appeals to the coder cum particle physicist inside me. Studying quantum fields and strongly correlated systems using tensor networks, quantum computing excites me as an aspiring theoretical physicist and a computational enthusiast.

My research experience has been in [near-field radiative heat transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_radiative_heat_transfer), [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) and [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson) phenomenology. 

I do yoga, read manga and watch anime in my free time.
