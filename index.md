I am a master's student at the [Department of Particle Physics and Astrophysics](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/particle/), [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/). I am currently working on particle physics phenomenology under the supervision of [Prof. Yosef Nir](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/particle/nir/group-members). 

In my future projects, I am interested in working on topics where deep learning and/or tensor networks overlap with areas of physics, particularly particle physics or condensed matter. Despite my lack of experience with high-performance computing (HPC), I suspect it is an area that I will enjoy.

My research experience has been in [near-field radiative heat transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_radiative_heat_transfer), [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) and [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson) phenomenology. 

I do yoga, read manga and watch anime in my free time.
