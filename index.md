I am a master's student at the [Department of Particle Physics and Astrophysics](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/particle/), [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/). I am currently working on particle physics phenomenology under the supervision of [Prof. Yosef Nir's group](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/particle/nir/group-members).
